/*
Type -> Easy to refer to the different properties + functions that a value has

Types can be grouped into;
  - Primitive Types
  - Object Types

Why do we care about types?
  - Types are used by the Typescript Compiler to analyze our code for errors
  - Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase

USE TYPES EVERYWHERE!
